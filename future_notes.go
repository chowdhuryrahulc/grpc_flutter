Hints: use stats package, calculate payload wirelength size, etc
How to attach stats package to NewServer? And what is stats.Handler?

todo Credentials? How?
todo Send data from database (not just send and recieve messages)

2) Send the listview to front-end  (Send data from database (not just send and recieve messages))
